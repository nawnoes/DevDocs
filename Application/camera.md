-  ios has the prop captureAudio as false as default. If you want to capture audio, pass true
read the doc https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-camera/blob/master/docs/RNCamera.md
- Not on iOS, this is enforced by the operating system. I saw some notes on turning off the shutter sound for Android somewhere. Apparently it's law in Japan that phone cameras must make a sound so that people can't surreptitiously take photos.
